# Intro
I am the co-founder and technical director of Arabclassroom where I build courses and projects as well as evaluations, with precision and to scale. I also advise startups. I am particularly interested in projects that touch on health and safety, imagery, social impact and education. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Arabclassroom, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies. I primarily work as a teacher but have broad experience across Arabclassroomâ€™s stack.
